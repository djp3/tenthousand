    <p><strong>Set-Up :</strong></p>
      <p> The game can be played with 2-5 players. The 2 players rules are slightly different so this requirements specifications are just for 3-5 players.        </p>
      <p>Each player picks a color and is given a certain number of cards of that particular color according to the number of players in the game. For 5 players, 4 small fields and 5 large fields are used by each player. However, if you go first or second you get 5 small fields instead of 4.        </p>
    <p>There are 3 types of cards in the game; irrigation (denoted by the crop circles), silo (denoted by the small circle or circles on the card), or building cards (denoted by the farm houses on the cards). Each player receives 2 small irrigation cards of their specific color, 1 small building card, and 1 small silo card. If you are either first or second, you get an extra small irrigation card. Each also gets 3 large irrigation cards, 1 large building card, and 1 large silo card.        </p>
      <p>The sizes of the card are set-up in that if the small cards are 1x1, the large cards are 2x2.</p>
      <p> Each player also receives 4 assignment cards. 2 major and 2 minor assignment cards. The major assignment cards have groups of 4 fields and are shaded. The minor assignment cards have groups of 3 fields and are not shaded. The cards are laid open in front of each player so that everyone may see them.</p>

  <p> <strong>Gameplay / Scoring : </strong></p>
  <p>The first player places one of his cards on the table or surface.</p>
  <p> The second player must place his card in a way that it is connecting to the first card. This rule applies as we go forth. A new card added must be attached to a previously placed card.
    </p>
  <p>Points are scored when a player recognizes that the most recent card added to the overall field matches one of his or her own assignment cards. A match with a minor assignment card, is worth 2 points to be summed up at the end of the game. A match with a major assignment card is worth 3 points.
    </p>
  <p>You may score by matching the field with your assignment card on any player's turn.</p>
  <p> After an assignment card is matched, the player has the option between a scoring bonus or a drawing bonus. The scoring bonus is based on the number of colors in the field with the assignment card matched. If the match is all one color, then the player receives a one point bonus recorded on the score board by moving the piece according to the point bonus reward. If there are 4 colors in the match then the player can move his piece 4 places resulting in a 4 point bonus. This applies for any number of colors in a match.</p>
  <p> The other option is the drawing bonus. The bonus is rewarded according to the number of fields in a match with an assignment card. If a match has all irrigation cards in the group, then the player is rewarded another assignment card of his or her choosing (minor or major). If there are all 3 types in the match, then the player is rewarded a 3 card drawing bonus and can choose any combination of minor or major assignment cards. This applies for any number of fields in a match.
    </p>
  <p>Each matched assignment card should be held onto, in one's own &quot;portfolio&quot;¬ù to be totaled at the end of the game.</p>
  <p> The game is over when every player has played every one of his or her cards. The score is then totaled based on the scoreboard from the scoring bonuses and the total sum from the assignment cards in the portfolios of each player matched. The player with the most points wins the game!
